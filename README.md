# Rosenbaum wedding

This is the (mostly) static site that hosts information about my wedding!

The statis portion is published with Github Pages ([wedding.rosenbaum.io](https://wedding.rosenbaum.io)), and makes use of some simple bootstrap themes.

To handle RSVPs graacefully, I've also written a lambda function that can be called as an ajax endpoint, which will add rsvps to a google spreadsheet!
